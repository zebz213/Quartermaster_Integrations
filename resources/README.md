# Quartermaster Integrations

Puts Quartermaster's nearby storage into the crafting window: how much of each ingredient you actually have, how many of the item you can craft, and how big a batch you can afford — counted with Quartermaster's own rules, so the numbers match what a craft will really pull.

---

## What it does

* **Available counts in every requirement row** — Each row shows the required amount plus what you hold across your pockets and nearby Quartermaster storage (e.g., `10 (16)`).
* **Batch-aware numbers** — Raise the craft amount in AAA Crafting or My Little UI and the rows scale with it, so a recipe needing 10 bronze reads `50` at a batch of 5. You can see what a batch actually costs before committing.
* **Counts you can trust** — Storage totals are requested directly from Quartermaster rather than estimated locally, meaning `CraftRange`, the per-chest **Crafting Supply** flag, ward access, in-use chests, and the global `CraftFromContainers` toggle are all fully respected. A chest you deliberately excluded from crafting supply will never inflate the display.
* **Max Craft that respects the station** — The max-craft figure follows the same accounting and never overrides the game: no station, or a station below the recipe's level, results in `0` rather than a phantom batch of 100.
* **Upgrade tab included** — Counts appear on the upgrade tab too, and its max-craft figure reports `0` when the next quality is unaffordable rather than a batch you could not pay for.
* **Honest craft button** — It enables only when the *whole batch* is affordable, and `-` always stays usable so you can never get stuck at a batch you cannot pay for.
* **Insufficient rows flash** — Colors and flash speed are configurable, so a missing ingredient is obvious at a glance.
* **Does not disturb your items** — ExtraSlots slot rows and typed slots are protected from Quartermaster's sort and store actions, and an open AdventureBackpacks backpack is never dumped into your inventory by a sort action.

## Integrations

| Mod | Required | What it adds here |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quartermaster** (`local.valheim.quartermaster`) | **Yes** — 0.1.66+ | The source of every storage count |
| **AAA Crafting** (`Azumatt.AzuAntiArthriticCrafting`) | No — 2.1.12+ | Craft-amount input, Max Craft label, batch cap of 100 |
| **My Little UI** (`shudnal.MyLittleUI`) | No — 1.2.32–1.2.33 | Craft-amount input, batch cap of 99 |
| **ExtraSlots** (`shudnal.ExtraSlots`) | No — 1.2.21+ | Slot rows and typed slots survive Quartermaster's sort/store |
| **AdventureBackpacks** (`vapok.mods.adventurebackpacks`) | No — 2.4.6+ | Backpack contents excluded from counts, backpack proxy never a store target |
| **AAABuildMenu** (`Azumatt.AAABuildMenu`) | No — 1.0.6+ | Pinned build rows show storage-inclusive have/need counts |
| **Epic Loot** (`randyknapp.mods.epicloot`) | No — 0.15.5+ | Enchanting and sacrifice costs can be paid from storage; the items are actually taken from the chests |
| **PlanBuild** (`marcopogo.PlanBuild`) | No — 0.20.0+ | Plan pieces can be placed from storage, including "hold to add materials" |
| **WardIsLove** (`Azumatt.WardIsLove`) | No — 4.0.9+ | Chests inside a ward you are not permitted on are excluded from counts and never pulled from |

Every optional integration is reflection-bound at startup and reports what it found. Missing one costs you that specific convenience, never the mod itself.

## How it works

Two rules keep the display honest:

1. **Storage numbers are requested from Quartermaster**, not recomputed locally. The mod binds `WarehouseService.CountAvailableNearPlayer`, the same query Quartermaster uses to decide what a craft may pull, so the UI cannot promise materials the craft would refuse.
2. **"Can I craft this?" is answered by the game.** The craft button is gated on `Player.HaveRequirements`, which Quartermaster makes storage-aware. The max-craft figure is computed from the same counts and reports `0` only when `HaveRequirements` agrees that nothing is craftable. The mod never invents a state the game disagrees with: if you cannot craft it, the row reads `0` and the button is disabled.

One more rule covers modded recipes: requirements your character does not recognize — such as the hidden upgrade tokens some modded gear uses — are ignored rather than treated as missing, so modded recipes are never falsely disabled.

**Material from other storage mods is not counted.** Every number here comes from Quartermaster. If another craft-from-container mod can also supply an ingredient, that stock will not appear in the displayed count — though the craft can still succeed, because the button and the max-craft figure defer to the game's requirement check rather than to these numbers.

## Installation

### With a mod manager (recommended)

Install through **Gale** or **r2modman**. Required dependencies will resolve automatically.

### Manual installation

1. Install [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/).
2. Install [Quartermaster](https://valheim.hexium.gg/mods/Vassteel/Quartermaster) (0.1.66 or newer). Optionally add AAA Crafting, My Little UI, ExtraSlots, and/or AdventureBackpacks.
3. Drop `QuarterMaster_Integrations.dll` into your `Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

## Configuration

Generated at `BepInEx/config/com.bootstrapboys.quartermaster_integrations.cfg` on first launch.

| Section | Key | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1. General` | `Enabled` | `true` | Turn the mod's UI changes off without uninstalling. |
| `1. General` | `RequirementDisplayMode` | `CombinedTotal` | How the available count is written (see below). |
| `1. General` | `DeferToOtherFormatting` | `false` | If AAA Crafting or AdventureBackpacks has already formatted a row, leave its text alone. Only enable this if you prefer their style. My Little UI's own "available resources amount" counts your pockets only, so deferring to it drops chest totals. |
| `2. Visuals` | `SufficientColor` | `(0.68, 0.91, 0.90, 1.00)` | Color of the available count when you have enough. |
| `2. Visuals` | `InsufficientFlashBrightColor` | `(1.00, 0.22, 0.22, 1.00)` | Bright end of the insufficient-material flash. |
| `2. Visuals` | `InsufficientFlashDarkColor` | `(0.45, 0.02, 0.02, 1.00)` | Dark end of the insufficient-material flash. |
| `2. Visuals` | `FlashSpeed` | `4.0` | Flash speed, 1–12. |
| `3. Debug` | `DebugMode` | `false` | Timestamped diagnostic log written to `BepInEx/BSBLogs/QuarterMaster_Integrations.log`. |

### Display modes

For a recipe needing 10 bronze, with 4 in your pockets and 12 in nearby chests:

| `RequirementDisplayMode` | Row reads | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CombinedTotal` (default) | `10 (16)` | Required (total available) |
| `SplitInventoryAndStorage` | `10 (4+12)` | Required (inventory + storage) |
| `TotalWithSplit` | `10 (16 [4+12])` | Required (total [inventory + storage]) |

> **Color format:** These values are stored as `(red, green, blue, alpha)` floats from `0` to `1`, not hex values. Hand-editing with a hex value will fail to parse, causing the default to be used instead.

---

## Debugging

Set `DebugMode = true` under `3. Debug` and the mod writes `BepInEx/BSBLogs/QuarterMaster_Integrations.log` (the file is named after the plugin and rewritten each launch) as well as the console:

| Line | What it proves |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[Patch] '<target>' applied` | that reflection patch bound at startup |
| `[Patches] <Type>.<Method> <- prefix N, postfix N, transpiler N, finalizer N` | the full inventory of methods this mod has patched — a missing one is a missing integration |
| `[Config] DisplayMode: …` | the settings that session actually ran with |
| `[Craft] '<item>' xN` then one row per requirement | `need N \| pockets A + storage B = C \| enough True/False` for the selected recipe |
| `[AAABuildMenu] '<item>': pockets A + storage B = C` | a pinned row's count changed, and from what |
| `[Integrations] EpicLoot: … PlanBuild: … WardIsLove: …` | which optional integrations bound this session |
| `[QM] Bindings: CountAvailableNearPlayer=… CraftStores=…` | which Quartermaster entry points resolved |
| `[EpicLoot] Took N/Mx '<item>' from storage` | an Epic Loot cost was actually paid out of a chest |
| `[PlanBuild] Plan costs include N storage container(s)` | PlanBuild is being offered storage (one line per 10 s) |
| `[WardIsLove] Excluded '<chest>' … from storage` | ward permissions hid a chest from storage (one line per 10 s) |

## Troubleshooting

**Check the load line first.** In your `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`, you should see:

```
Quartermaster Integrations v<version> loaded (MLUI: True, AAA: True, ExtraSlots: True, Backpacks: True, BuildMenu: True, EpicLoot: True, PlanBuild: True, WardIsLove: True, QM storage query: True, QM storages: True).
```

* `QM storage query: False` — Quartermaster is older than 0.1.66 or the method was not found; counts will fall back to pockets only. An explanatory `[QM]` error will appear above this line.
* `QM storages: False` — Quartermaster's container list was not found; Epic Loot and PlanBuild cannot take items from chests, and the WardIsLove filter is inactive. Counts still work.
* `EpicLoot: False` with an `[EpicLoot]` error — usually **EpicLootContainerBridge** being installed at the same time (see below).
* A `[Patch] 'something' skipped/failed` line indicates an integration that failed to bind, along with the reason why.

**Numbers look wrong?** The count is limited by three of Quartermaster's own rules. If the display shows pockets only, it is one of these:

* **Range** — a chest outside Quartermaster's `CraftRange` is not counted at all.
* **Chest flag** — the per-chest **Crafting Supply** toggle. A chest with it off is ignored on purpose.
* **Global toggle** — Quartermaster's `CraftFromContainers`. With it off, storage is not offered to crafting at all.

All three are enforced by Quartermaster, not by this mod, so the display follows them exactly.

**Installed EpicLootContainerBridge too?** This mod refuses to register its Epic Loot provider while that bridge is present, because Epic Loot sums every provider and your chest totals would double. Remove the bridge to use this integration instead; the `[EpicLoot]` error in the log names the conflict.

**Epic Loot's enchanting UI lists storage items?** Epic Loot has a `SpendOnlyStorageMods` setting. Add `bootstrapboys.quartermaster` to it if you want storage to pay costs without showing up as editable inventory in menus that move items around.

**PlanBuild or WardIsLove not taking effect?** Both need `QM storages: True` in the load line plus their own flag in `[Integrations]`. WardIsLove only ever removes containers: a chest outside every ward is never affected, and inside a ward where you are permitted nothing changes.

**Something else?** Set `DebugMode = true`, reproduce the issue, and include both `BepInEx/BSBLogs/QuarterMaster_Integrations.log` and `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` in your bug report.
